# Telnyx Conferencing — Feature & Infrastructure Changes

**Branch**: `improve-tts-overalll`
**Date**: 2026-04-11

## Goal

Enable three-way calling (conference merge) for Telnyx connections. This required building the conference service layer, a webhook relay for B-leg discovery, SIP header extraction for reliable call correlation, and migration from Credential Connections to a Call Control App.

## Status

**Phase 3 planned** — local audio mixing (app-side conference bridge).

Phase 1 built the full conference service layer but hit a fundamental blocker: Telnyx's Conference API does not support Credential Connections (no media redirection, no REST call control actions, identical A/B-leg CCIDs). Telnyx support confirmed this and recommended migrating to a Call Control App.

Phase 2 refactored the provider and service to use a Call Control App connection. However, testing revealed that linking a credential connection to a Call Control App in the Telnyx portal would **reassign the connection away from SIP Trunking to the Voice API**, breaking SIP registration and normal calling. There is no way to keep the credential connection as a SIP Trunk while also routing its calls through a Call Control App. The Telnyx Conference API is effectively unusable with our SIP credential connection architecture.

Phase 3 will abandon the Telnyx Conference API entirely and implement **local audio mixing** in the app. The Flutter app becomes the conference bridge: audio from Call A's WebRTC render stream is injected into Call B's capture stream, and vice versa. No server-side conference bridge is needed.

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. SIP Header Extraction (`sip_ua_helper.dart`)

Telnyx embeds `X-Telnyx-Call-Control-ID`, `X-Telnyx-Session-ID`, and `X-Telnyx-Leg-ID` in SIP 180 Ringing and 200 OK responses. These are captured directly from the SIP signaling and stored on the `Call` object, providing the most reliable A-leg correlation (more reliable than phone number matching against the active_calls API).

### 2. Conference Merge Flow (`conference_service.dart`)

The `_mergeTelnyx()` method follows this sequence:

1. **Pre-unhold** — any held SIP legs are unheld via re-INVITE (`a=sendrecv`) before touching the Conference API, ensuring B-legs have an active media path
2. **Wait 2s** — for the SIP re-INVITE round-trip to complete
3. **Resolve legs** — three-pass matching (SIP header ccid → phone number → elimination) against the active_calls API
4. **Create conference** with the first leg's `call_control_id`
5. **Join remaining A-legs** with 1.5s stagger
6. **Join B-legs** — webhook-captured B-leg ccids (with Call Control App these are distinct from A-leg ccids and must be explicitly joined)
7. **Wait 2s** — Call Control App conferences handle media redirection server-side (Telnyx sends re-INVITEs to redirect RTP to the conference bridge)
8. **Verify participants** via `GET /conferences/{id}/participants`

### 3. WebSocket B-Leg Relay (`static_server/src/main.rs`)

The Rust server receives Telnyx webhook POSTs at `/web_hooks/telnyx`, extracts `call.initiated` events with `direction=outgoing` (B-legs), and broadcasts the `call_control_id` to all connected WebSocket clients at `/ws/call_control`. The Flutter app's `ConferenceService` maintains a persistent WebSocket connection with auto-reconnect.

### 4. Call Control App Setup

The credential connection must be linked to a Call Control App in the Telnyx Mission Control Portal. The Call Control App's webhook URL points to the Rust relay server, which broadcasts events to the Flutter client via WebSocket. Call parking is no longer needed — Call Control Apps natively surface B-leg events with distinct `call_control_id`s.

## Issues History

### Phase 1 — Conference service layer built, Telnyx API blockers discovered

1. Conference API does not redirect media for credential connections
2. Call Control REST actions return 404 for credential connection CCIDs
3. B-leg CCIDs identical to A-leg CCIDs

### Phase 2 — Call Control App migration attempted, portal blocker discovered

4. Linking credential connection to a Call Control App in the Telnyx portal reassigns the connection from SIP Trunking to Voice API, breaking SIP registration and normal calling. No dropdown or option exists to keep both.
5. Active calls API returns stale records and `from=null to=null` for credential connection calls

## Phase 3: Local Audio Mixing (Planned)

### Problem

The Telnyx Conference API requires a Call Control App connection, but linking our SIP credential connection to a Call Control App reassigns it away from SIP Trunking — breaking registration and normal calling. There is no portal option to keep both. The Conference API's `createConference` and `joinConference` calls succeed on credential connection CCIDs, but Telnyx never redirects media to the conference bridge (RTP stays on the original path, `remoteRMS=0.0` after merge).

### Approach: App-side conference bridge

Instead of relying on Telnyx to mix audio server-side, the app mixes audio locally across its two concurrent WebRTC sessions. The native `AudioTap` layer (macOS Swift) already supports conference mode (`APM conference mode ON`) and manages separate capture/render audio processing chains per call.

### Key design questions to resolve

1. **Multi-PeerConnection audio routing**: Currently WebRTC uses a single PeerConnection per call. With two concurrent calls, macOS will have two sets of capture/render audio processors. Need to confirm the AudioTap layer can distinguish and cross-route between them.

2. **Capture injection**: The `CapturePostProc` already injects TTS audio into the outbound stream. For conferencing, it needs to also inject the *other call's render audio* into each call's capture stream. This means Call A's `RenderPreProc` output must be readable by Call B's `CapturePostProc`, and vice versa.

3. **Echo / feedback prevention**: When Call A's remote audio is injected into Call B's capture, and Call B's remote audio is injected into Call A's capture, there's a risk of audio feedback loops. AEC is currently disabled in conference mode — may need a simple "don't re-inject what you just received" guard, or a short mixing buffer with origin tagging.

4. **Mic sharing**: The mic signal needs to go into both calls' capture streams. Currently the mic IOProc feeds one ring buffer. Both `CapturePostProc` instances would need to read from the same mic source without contention.

5. **Merge trigger**: The existing `_mergeTelnyx()` flow in `ConferenceService` would be replaced (or a new `_mergeLocal()` path added) that simply activates cross-injection in the AudioTap layer and unholds both SIP legs. No Telnyx REST API calls needed.

6. **TTS routing in conference**: When the AI agent speaks (ElevenLabs TTS), the audio currently goes into the capture stream. In conference mode, TTS output should be injected into both calls' capture streams so all parties hear the agent.

### Existing infrastructure to leverage

- **`AudioTap` (Swift, macOS)**: Already has `enterCallMode`/`exitCallMode`, conference mode flag, `setConferenceMode`, separate `CapturePostProc`/`RenderPreProc` per PeerConnection, ring buffers for mic and TTS injection.
- **`ConferenceService` (Dart)**: Leg tracking, hold/unhold, merge orchestration — the Dart-side coordination is already built. Just needs a `_mergeLocal()` path.
- **`CallScreen`**: Conference UI (add call, merge button, per-leg hold) is already implemented.

### What can be removed (Phase 3 cleanup)

- Telnyx Conference REST API calls (`createConference`, `joinConference`, `listParticipants`, hold/unhold participant)
- B-leg webhook discovery (WebSocket relay, `extractBLegFromWebhook`)
- `TelnyxConferenceProvider` class (or gut it to just `lookupActiveCalls` if still useful)
- Rust server webhook broadcast (`/ws/call_control` endpoint)
- Call Control App in Telnyx portal (can be deleted)

## Appendix: Telnyx Support Response (2026-04-15)

Telnyx confirmed the Conference API is **not supported for Credential Connections** — it requires a Call Control App connection. Key points:

- Conference API media redirection only works with Call Control App connections
- `call_control_id` from `X-Telnyx-Call-Control-ID` SIP headers on credential connections is for identification/tracking only, not full API control
- Call Control Apps provide: full Conference API, all REST call control actions, separate A/B-leg CCIDs
- Stale active_calls records may be a Telnyx data sync bug — report with connection ID and timestamps

**Solution applied**: Link existing credential connection to a new Call Control App in Mission Control Portal. SIP registration/calling unchanged; conference operations now use Call Control App's connection ID.

## Phase 4: Add Call Modal — Remote Identity Display

### Problem

When the "Add Call" modal transitions to its connected state, it only showed the raw dialed phone number with a plain green circle avatar. The main call screen shows the full remote identity (contact name, identicon avatar, formatted number via demo mode masking), but the add-call modal didn't match.

### Solution

Updated `_buildConnectedView()` in `AddCallModal` to mirror the call screen's identity display:

- Looks up the dialed number in `ContactService` to resolve a contact name
- Filters out "name is just a phone number" cases (same heuristic as the call screen)
- Applies `DemoModeService` masking for both name and phone
- Replaces the plain green circle with `ContactIdenticon` (same deterministic avatar used on the call screen)
- Shows contact name (24px bold) + formatted phone below when a contact matches, or just the formatted phone when no contact exists
- Status row ("Connected" + timer) moved to top to match call screen layout
